## ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland

### Dual Registry System

Poland's implementation uses a **hybrid approach** with two different APIs:

- **biznes.gov.pl API**: Used for search across both registries and for CEIDG entities (individual businesses and sole proprietorships)
- **KRS API**: Used directly for companies and legal entities registered in the National Court Register

### Dual ID System with Prefixes

To distinguish between the two registry sources, our system uses prefixed identifiers:

- **`nip-{number}`**: CEIDG entities (individual businesses) - handled via biznes.gov.pl
- **`krs-{number}`**: KRS entities (companies and legal entities) - handled via direct KRS API

This approach ensures optimal data retrieval by using biznes.gov.pl for search and CEIDG data, while leveraging the specialized KRS API for comprehensive company information and documents.
