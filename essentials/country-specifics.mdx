### Data Retrieval

We use both the **Handelregister** and the **UnternehmenRegister** to retrieve data and documents. This dual-source approach enables a fallback mechanism, ensuring higher data availability.

However, in some cases, both sources might fail. In such scenarios, our system implements a retry mechanism:

- An initial retry after **2 minutes**.
- If that fails, we continue with an exponential backoff strategy for up to **12 hours**, with a maximum of **10 retries**.
- We only retrieve documents associated with the specific company ID provided. Documents associated with companies that have been merged into this company are not retrieved at this time. Please contact contact@getsemaphore.com if you require this functionality.

### Shareholders Extraction

For shareholder extraction, we employ a **Three-Source Extraction Strategy**. The system automatically selects the best method based on the company's legal form.

- **Gesellschafterliste extraction:** Used for legal forms like **GmbH, UG, KG, etc.** Data is extracted from shareholder lists.
- **Trade register analysis:** Used for legal forms like **AG, SE, KGaA.** Information is gathered from profit transfer agreements and control statements in the trade register.
- **Financial statement analysis:** A new method to identify the parent company from annual reports.

### Dual Registry System

Poland's implementation uses a **hybrid approach** with two different APIs:

- **biznes.gov.pl API**: Used for search across both registries and for CEIDG entities (individual businesses and sole proprietorships)
- **KRS API**: Used directly for companies and legal entities registered in the National Court Register

### Dual ID System with Prefixes

To distinguish between the two registry sources, our system uses prefixed identifiers:

- **`nip-{number}`**: CEIDG entities (individual businesses) - handled via biznes.gov.pl
- **`krs-{number}`**: KRS entities (companies and legal entities) - handled via direct KRS API

This approach ensures optimal data retrieval by using biznes.gov.pl for search and CEIDG data, while leveraging the specialized KRS API for comprehensive company information and documents.
