### Data Retrieval

We use both the **Handelregister** and the **UnternehmenRegister** to retrieve data and documents. This dual-source approach enables a fallback mechanism, ensuring higher data availability.

However, in some cases, both sources might fail. In such scenarios, our system implements a retry mechanism:

- An initial retry after **2 minutes**.
- If that fails, we continue with an exponential backoff strategy for up to **12 hours**, with a maximum of **10 retries**.

### Shareholders Extraction

For shareholder extraction, we employ a **Three-Source Extraction Strategy**. The system automatically selects the best method based on the company's legal form.

- **Gesellschafterliste extraction:** Used for legal forms like **GmbH, UG, KG, etc.** Data is extracted from company statutes and shareholder lists.
- **Trade register analysis:** Used for legal forms like **AG, SE, KGaA.** Information is gathered from profit transfer agreements and control statements in the trade register.
- **Financial statement analysis:** A new method to identify the parent company from annual reports.
