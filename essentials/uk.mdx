# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom

## Company Identifiers

The UK implementation provides comprehensive company identifiers through the Companies House API:

- **companiesHouseNumber**: Primary company registration number (e.g., "03789983")
- **jurisdiction**: Company jurisdiction within the UK (e.g., "england-wales", "scotland", "northern-ireland")

## Search Capabilities

- **By company name** (contains matching): `search("TECHNOLOGY UK LIMITED")`
- **By registration number**: `search("03789983")`
- **Overseas companies** (FC prefix): `search("FC022268")`
- **UK establishments** (BR prefix): `search("BR011501")`

## Activity Classifications

For activity codes, you will always receive the exact **SIC codes** as returned by Companies House, with AI mapping to international standards:

- **SIC Codes**: UK Standard Industrial Classification codes (guaranteed accuracy)
- **NACE Mapping**: European standard classification
- **ISIC Mapping**: International Standard Industrial Classification

## Legal Forms

For legal forms, we have a finite number of possible values for `localName`, directly mapped to standardized classifications. The UK supports 40+ legal form classifications:

## Officer Role Processing

The UK implementation uses **formal parsing** to process company officers with high accuracy and consistency:

### Role Classification Logic

**Legal Representatives vs Other Key Persons:**
- **Directors** â†’ `legalRepresentatives` (signing authority)
- **Secretaries** â†’ `otherKeyPersons` (administrative/oversight roles)
- **Corporate officers** â†’ Detected by name patterns (`LIMITED`, `LTD`, `PLC`, etc.)

### Role Name Priority

For maximum accuracy, we prioritize data sources in this order:

1. **Occupation field** (primary source when available)
2. **Officer role mapping** (fallback for standardized roles)

**Examples:**
- Officer with `occupation: "Managing Director"` â†’ `role.localName: "Managing Director"`
- Officer with `officer_role: "director"` but no occupation â†’ `role.localName: "Director"`

### Role Standardization

All officer roles are enriched with standardized classifications:

- **Legal Representatives**: `SemaphoreStandardRoleEnum` (Director, Manager, CEO, etc.)
- **Other Key Persons**: `OtherKeyPersonRoleEnum` (Secretary, Auditor, Compliance Officer, etc.)
- **Enrichment**: AI-powered mapping to international role standards

### Data Quality Features

- **Active officers only**: Resigned officers filtered out by default for cleaner datasets
- **Corporate detection**: Automatic identification of corporate vs individual officers
- **Address parsing**: Full UK address normalization with country code mapping
- **Name formatting**: Standardized parsing of both individual and corporate names
