Semaphore offers two primary methods to search for a company:

1. Company name
2. Registration number

It's important to note that the availability of these search methods can vary depending on the country you're searching in.

Search response times can fluctuate based on the specific registry we need to query:

- Fastest responses: A few hundred milliseconds
- Slowest responses: Up to ten seconds
