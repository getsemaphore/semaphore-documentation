## ✨ Week 25 Highlights

**Key improvements delivered this week:**

- **🎯 Enhanced Ownership Graph Analysis** - Improved UBO identification with dual calculation methods and better data visualization through nodes and edges structure
- **🇩🇪 Intelligent German Shareholder Computation** - Multi-source extraction strategy combining Gesellschafterliste, trade register analysis, and financial statement analysis
- **🇵🇱 Poland Support Launch** - New comprehensive support for Polish entities with dual-source integration covering both CEIDG and KRS registries

## Platform

### 🎯 **Improved Ownership Graph**

We're launching enhanced ownership graph analysis with better UBO identification and cleaner data presentation. This feature has been tested with German companies and provides valuable cross-checking capabilities against Transparenzregister data.

**🔍 Enhanced UBO Identification**

- **Dual calculation methods**: Accumulation and domination approaches with 25% ownership threshold
- **Corporate UBO flagging** when ownership chains end at companies rather than individuals

**📊 Simplified Data Format**

- **Nodes and edges structure** for clearer ownership visualization
- **Cross-border ownership support** with automatic termination at individual shareholders

**🛡️ Improved Reliability**

- **Better error handling** with partial results and circular ownership detection
- **Entity deduplication** and search fallbacks when direct data is unavailable

## Countries

### 🇩🇪 Germany

**Enhanced Shareholder Data Extraction**

We've improved German shareholder identification with a multi-source approach.

**📋 Three-Source Extraction Strategy**

The system automatically selects the best method based on company legal form:

- **Gesellschafterliste extraction** (GmbH, UG, KG, etc.) - from company shareholder lists
- **Trade register analysis** (AG, SE, KGaA) - from profit transfer agreements and control statements
- **Financial statement analysis** _(NEW)_ - parent company identification from annual reports

**🎯 Key Improvements**

- **Multi-source validation** combines results from different document types for better accuracy
- **Transparenzregister cross-checking** provides alternative verification of ownership data
- **Automatic fallbacks** when primary data sources are unavailable

### 🇪🇸 Spain

- **Fixed document retrieval and listing** - Resolved an issue caused by a deployment mistake on our side that prevented retrieval and listing of Spanish documents, restoring full functionality for Spanish company document access.
- **Improved parsing of activities** - Enhanced the extraction and processing of company activity data for better accuracy and consistency.

### 🇮🇹 Italy

- **Improved parsing of activities** - Enhanced the extraction and processing of company activity data for better accuracy and consistency.

### 🇫🇷 France

- **Fixed Ultimate Beneficial Owner retrieval** - Resolved issues with UBO data extraction and processing, ensuring reliable access to French beneficial ownership information.

### 🇲🇹 Malta

- **Switched companyProfile to async process** - To overcome instability at the registry level, we will thus be able to automatically retry retrieving the company profile a few seconds after if the registry is unavailable.

### 🇵🇹 Portugal

- **Improved shareholder parsing** - Enhanced the extraction and processing of shareholder data for better accuracy and consistency.

### 🇵🇱 Poland

**Comprehensive Polish Business Registry Support**

We're excited to announce full support for Polish entities with our dual-source integration approach.

**🏢 Dual Registry Coverage**

- **CEIDG (Central Registration and Information on Business Activity)** - Individual businesses and sole proprietorships via biznes.gov.pl
- **KRS (National Court Register)** - Companies and legal entities via direct KRS API

**📊 Available Data Points**

- **`companyProfile`** - Complete entity information including legal representatives, shareholders, and business activities
- **`availableDocuments`** - Document listings tailored to entity type and registry source

**📄 Document Support**

- **Historical Trade Register Extract** - Available for KRS entities with comprehensive historical data

**🔍 Smart ID System**

- **`nip-{number}`** prefix for CEIDG entities (individual businesses)
- **`krs-{number}`** prefix for KRS entities (companies and legal entities)

### 🇱🇺 Luxembourg

- **Added trade registry extract support** - Introduced comprehensive trade registry extract functionality for Luxembourg companies, providing access to official company documentation and registration details. Please note that retrieval may take up to one hour as the Luxembourg registry requires this processing time.

### 🇩🇪 Germany

- **Added fallback to Handelsregister for document listing and retrieval** - Implemented fallback mechanism to the Handelsregister for document listing and retrieval (except for some financials, which will come later), resulting in improved robustness. When both registers fail simultaneously, the system will retry after 2 minutes for 10 times, then continue with exponential backoff up to 12 hours.

  **Major Data Model Enhancements**
</Callout>

We are progressively rolling out these data model enhancements to our supported countries, depending on the availability of data in the currently connected registries. This means that not all enhancements may be available for every country immediately, but coverage will expand as registry data allows.

- **Establishments** <Icon icon="building" color="#3B82F6" /> - Now you can retrieve all establishments associated with a company, including branch offices, subsidiaries, and other affiliated locations that operate under the parent company's legal identity. This helps you understand a company's physical presence and operational footprint.

- **Other Key People** <Icon icon="users" color="#8B5CF6" /> - Introducing a new data point to capture important company personnel beyond legal representatives. This includes board members, auditors, commissioners, and other significant roles. Unlike legal representatives who have binding authority, Other Key People provides visibility into the broader governance and oversight structure of a company.

- **Phone Numbers** <Icon icon="phone" color="#10B981" /> - Companies can now include multiple phone numbers in E.164 format (e.g., +33123456789), making it easier to establish contact through official channels.

- **Website** <Icon icon="globe" color="#F59E0B" /> - Retrieve the official company website URL directly from the API response, providing quick access to the company's online presence.

- **Status Details (Beta)** <Icon icon="info-circle" color="#EF4444" /> - We're introducing `statusDetailsBeta`, which provides enriched information about company status changes, including closure reasons, liquidation details, and important dates. <strong>The data model for status details is highly likely to evolve</strong> as we gather feedback and adapt to the diversity of registry data. As this feature is in beta, we're actively collecting feedback to refine the data structure and ensure it meets your needs.

- **Semaphore Standard Roles Revision** <Icon icon="users" color="#8B5CF6" /> - The roles in Semaphore Standard for legal representatives have been revised to cover a broader range of situations and to ensure there is no overlap with Other Key People. This provides clearer, more accurate role classification across jurisdictions.

## Countries

### 🇳🇴 Norway

- **Initial support for Norway** - We're excited to announce support for Norwegian companies, with our integration of the Norwegian Business Registry (Brønnøysundregistrene)! Currently available data points:

  **Key Feature Release**
</Callout>

- **Company Detention Tree (Beta)** <Icon icon="diagram-project" color="#16A34A" /> - Introducing `graphBeta`, a new datapoint that allows you to retrieve the complete detention tree of a company. This feature helps visualize company ownership structures and can assist in identifying potential Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs). To use this feature, simply include the "graphBeta" datapoint in your API calls.

<Note>
  This feature is currently in early beta. As it requires retrieving companyProfile data for each entity in the ownership tree, usage may incur
  significant costs. We recommend reaching out to become a design partner to help shape this feature's development and discuss optimal usage patterns.
