<Update label="Week 09, 2025">

## Platform

- **Optimized request processing pipeline**, resulting in an average **2 seconds reduction** in response time across all endpoints.
- **Fixed performance bottlenecks** when processing companies with large document collections by implementing a **faster inference endpoint** for document metadata processing.
- **Enhanced performance logging** across the application to better identify and address bottlenecks.

<Note>We are actively working on improving overall performance, with a focus on inference speed optimization. A **faster inference solution** is currently in development.</Note>

## Countries

### 🇮🇹 Italy
- Added support for asynchronous data retrieval from the Italian Chamber of Commerce (Camerale). As a result, **companyProfile for Italy is now an asynchronous data point**.

### 🇩🇪 Germany
- Implemented fallback to Handelsregister when Unternehmensregister is unavailable for search and companyProfile.

### 🇪🇸 Spain
- Improved overall speed and reliability of Spanish company data retrieval through infrastructure optimizations.
- Added support for asynchronous data retrieval for legalRepresentatives in Spain. Note that base companyProfile data still remains synchronous. This change prevents blocking access to base company data when fetching many legal representatives, which could be time-consuming for companies with extensive representative lists.
- As a result, **companyProfile for Spain is now a partially asynchronous data point**.

### 🇨🇳 China
- Improved overall speed and reliability of Chinese company data retrieval through infrastructure optimizations.

### 🇳🇱 Netherlands
- Updated document listing functionality to match KVK's new API specifications, restoring the ability to list available documents for Dutch companies.
