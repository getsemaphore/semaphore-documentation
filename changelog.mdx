  **Major Data Model Enhancements**
</Callout>

We are progressively rolling out these data model enhancements to our supported countries, depending on the availability of data in the currently connected registries. This means that not all enhancements may be available for every country immediately, but coverage will expand as registry data allows.

- **Establishments** <Icon icon="building" color="#3B82F6" /> - Now you can retrieve all establishments associated with a company, including branch offices, subsidiaries, and other affiliated locations that operate under the parent company's legal identity. This helps you understand a company's physical presence and operational footprint.

- **Other Key People** <Icon icon="users" color="#8B5CF6" /> - Introducing a new data point to capture important company personnel beyond legal representatives. This includes board members, auditors, commissioners, and other significant roles. Unlike legal representatives who have binding authority, Other Key People provides visibility into the broader governance and oversight structure of a company.

- **Phone Numbers** <Icon icon="phone" color="#10B981" /> - Companies can now include multiple phone numbers in E.164 format (e.g., +33123456789), making it easier to establish contact through official channels.

- **Website** <Icon icon="globe" color="#F59E0B" /> - Retrieve the official company website URL directly from the API response, providing quick access to the company's online presence.

- **Status Details (Beta)** <Icon icon="info-circle" color="#EF4444" /> - We're introducing `statusDetailsBeta`, which provides enriched information about company status changes, including closure reasons, liquidation details, and important dates. <strong>The data model for status details is highly likely to evolve</strong> as we gather feedback and adapt to the diversity of registry data. As this feature is in beta, we're actively collecting feedback to refine the data structure and ensure it meets your needs.

- **Semaphore Standard Roles Revision** <Icon icon="users" color="#8B5CF6" /> - The roles in Semaphore Standard for legal representatives have been revised to cover a broader range of situations and to ensure there is no overlap with Other Key People. This provides clearer, more accurate role classification across jurisdictions.

## Countries

  **Key Feature Release**
</Callout>

- **Company Detention Tree (Beta)** <Icon icon="diagram-project" color="#16A34A" /> - Introducing `graphBeta`, a new datapoint that allows you to retrieve the complete detention tree of a company. This feature helps visualize company ownership structures and can assist in identifying potential Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs). To use this feature, simply include the "graphBeta" datapoint in your API calls.

<Note>
  This feature is currently in early beta. As it requires retrieving companyProfile data for each entity in the ownership tree, usage may incur
  significant costs. We recommend reaching out to become a design partner to help shape this feature's development and discuss optimal usage patterns.
